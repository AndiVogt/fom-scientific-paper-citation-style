## Citation Style Examples

Here are some examples of how the citation style works:

### 1. Journal Article Citation (Indirect Citation)

For an indirect citation from a journal article, the citation will look like this:


- **"Cf."**: Indicates an indirect citation.
- **Author names**: Italicized as per the guidelines.
- **Year of publication**: Follows the author's name, separated by a comma.
- **Page number**: Prefixed with **p.**.

### 2. Web Source Citation (Indirect Citation)

When citing a web source, the citation includes the title, URL, and access date:


- **Title**: The full title of the webpage is included.
- **URL**: The link to the source is provided.
- **Access date**: Indicates when the source was accessed.

### 3. Consecutive Citation (Using Ibid.)

If you cite the same source consecutively, you should use **"Ibid."** along with the page number, if applicable:


- **"Ibid."**: Used to reference the same source as the previous footnote.
- **Page number**: If you are citing a different page in the same source, include the page number.

### 4. Book Citation (Without a URL)

For books and journal articles that do not require a title or URL, the citation looks like this:


- **No title**: For books and journal articles, the title is omitted unless specified.

## Testing Your Changes

If you're contributing to the project, it's essential to test your changes in a citation manager (such as Zotero or Mendeley) to ensure compatibility. Here’s how you can test:

1. Make sure your `.csl` file is correctly structured by using the [CSL Validator](https://validator.citationstyles.org/).
2. Install the citation style in Zotero or Mendeley using the instructions above.
3. Create a test document in Word, Google Docs, or another text editor and generate citations using the new style.
4. Compare the output to the examples provided here or in the FOM citation guide to verify correctness.
